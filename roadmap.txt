Roadmap
=======

What needs to be done with this project? What I want from this project?

Summapy:
--------

Ponydownloader is to get images from derpiboo.ru by imageid or by iterating search/lists. It should remember what imageids it already downloaded and not to query them again.
Program should be controlled by flags and support '--version' and '--help' with default response to erroneous flags being same as --help.
Flags should allow filtering on server-side or on client-side, if server-side query filtering does not provide all needed filtering options.
Program behavior should be manipulated by human-readable confuguration file config.ini
Ability to work anonimously or with key login.

Behavior:
---------

If no flags or arguments given, os.Exit(0) as there is nothing to do. (possibly, interactive mode?)
If argument is a number, attempt to interpret it as imageid.
If argument is not a number, -h. Will be provided by flag package
If --version, print version and exit
If -t, search by tag in argument. Download all filtered images
Modificator -bp adds start page
Modificator -ep adds stop page
Modificator -r adds minimal rating
Modificator -R adds maximal rating

Filters, work only with -t, need revising

derpibo.ru is 1-indexed, default stoppage is 0, equivalent to go through all
	
Todo:
-----

- get image json from derpiboo.ru - done
- implement response to empty argument line -done
- implement check for http return code
- download image by imageid - done
- add flags - done, partially
- add search by tag json - done partially
- implement database
- implement default config.ini writing / validity checking - partially, needs more checks
- implement change of directory for containing downloaded images - done
- implement directory creation according to search query
- throw extracted imageids at downloading function - need to be refactored
