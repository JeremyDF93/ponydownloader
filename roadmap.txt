Roadmap
=======

Summapy:
--------

Ponydownloader is to get images from derpiboo.ru by imageid or by iterating search/lists. It should remember what imageids it already downloaded and not to query them again.
Program should be controlled by flags and support '-v'ersion and '-h'elp with default response to erroneous flags being same as -h.
Flags should allow filtering on server-side or on client-side, if server-side query filtering does not provide all needed filtering options.
Program behavior should be manipulated by human-readable confuguration file config.ini
Ability to work anonimously or with key login.

Behavior:
---------

If no flags or arguments given, os.Exit(0) as there is nothing to do. (possibly, interactive mode?)
If argument is a number, attempt to interpret it as imageid.
If argument is not a number, -h. Will be provided by flag package
If --version, print version and exit
If -t, search by tag in argument. Download all filtered images
Flag -p adds start page
Flag -sp adds stop page

Filters, work only with -t, need revising
Flag -r adds minimal rating
Flag -R adds maximal rating

derpibo.ru is 1-indexed, default stoppage is 0, equivalent to go through all
